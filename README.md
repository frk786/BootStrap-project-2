- # _BootStrap_
  Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework used for developing responsive and mobile-first web applications. It includes a set of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML components that help build websites quickly and easily. Bootstrap provides pre-designed templates for common elements like navigation bars, buttons, forms, grids, and typography, so developers don’t need to start from scratch.
